First install vagrant from http://www.vagrantup.com

Once installed, download this project, eg with git:

  git clone https://github.com/raphinou/ocsigen-vagrant-env.git
  
Then go in the directory and simply run 

  vagrant up 

and the vm will be built with an ubuntu 14.04, using the system's ocaml and opam version.

The installation of the opam packages is done by the script provisioning.sh
Two versions of this script are provided:
  * provisioning-dev.sh which installs the latests development version of packages
  * provisioning-prod.sh which installs the production, stable versions
To use either of those, just copy or link the file as provisioning.sh.

The src subdirectory is mounted in the virtual machine under /vagrant.
To run your code in the virtual machine started by vagrant, you may create
a src subdirectory containing your code. Then you log in the virtual machine with 
  
  vagrant ssh

You can then go in your src directory:
  
  cd /vagrant

and compile and run your project as usual.

The port 8080 of you computer is mapped to the port 8080 of the virtual machine. To access
you ocsigen app from your desktop you can thus open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Working on the source code can be done either from the host running vagrant, or from within 
the virtual machine. One thing to note is that the mounted filesystem does not support the
creation of fifo, and so the <commandpipe> setting in the ocsigen config file has to be set
to a path out of the /vagrant directory, eg /tmp/ocsigen-app-cmd

Vagrant itself is configured with the Vagranfile.
